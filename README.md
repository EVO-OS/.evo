# .evo Package Format

## Introduction
The .evo package format is a versatile package management system designed to be compatible with various platforms, including mobile devices. It combines features from popular formats like .deb and .apk to provide a unified solution for software distribution and installation.

## File Structure
The .evo file consists of three main sections: header, metadata, data, and footer.

### Header
```c
struct evo_header {
    char magic[8];        // Magic number for .evo files
    uint32_t version;     // Version of the .evo format
    uint32_t metadata_size; // Size of metadata section
    uint64_t data_size;   // Size of the data section
};
```

### Footer
```c
struct evo_footer {
    uint32_t checksum;    // Checksum for data integrity
};
```

## Usage
The .evo format comes with three main tools: evo-create, evo-read, and evo-modify.

### Creating a .evo package
